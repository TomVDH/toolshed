"""PreToolUse hook for adjudant: schema gate on vault writes.

Validates the PROPOSED frontmatter of a Write landing under the resolved
vault project, using the same FIELD_SCHEMA detector that `check` reports and
`clean` feature 4 repairs. Catching drift at write time is what lets
vault-standards.md stop restating enforceable detail.

  - BLOCK (exit 2) on missing required fields or a type/node_type conflict.
    PreToolUse exit 2 stops the tool and feeds stderr back to the model, so
    it corrects in the same turn.
  - ALLOW SILENTLY on unknown fields. This used to print a warning, but a
    PreToolUse hook's stderr only reaches anyone on a NON-ZERO exit, so the
    warning was written to nobody. `check` reports unknown fields and `clean`
    strips them, which is where the correction belongs.
  - FAIL OPEN (exit 0) on anything infrastructural. A write must never be
    blocked because a hook had a bad day.

Write-only: an Edit payload carries old_string/new_string, not the resulting
file, so the outcome cannot be judged without simulating the edit. Edits keep
clean as their backstop.
