"""Drift canary - has the model stopped following its standing instructions?

SessionStart states one rule: end every message with a codeword. This hook
reads `last_assistant_message` on Stop and records whether it did.

The value is that the rule is trivial. A model that stops honouring a one-word
instruction it was given minutes ago has stopped honouring instructions
generally, and everything else it says this session is worth less. That is the
moment to start fresh, and nothing else tells you it has arrived.

Block once, then report. The first miss blocks and asks the model to re-read
its instructions; every later miss is only recorded, because coercing
compliance past that point manufactures the appearance of health. The miss is
counted either way: if a block makes the retry succeed and the miss were
forgotten, the counter would read clean through the degradation it exists to
catch.
