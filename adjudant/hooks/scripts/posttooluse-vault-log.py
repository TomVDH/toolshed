"""PostToolUse hook for adjudant.

Two mechanical jobs on tool writes under {vault}/projects/{slug}/:

  1. Append a `- HH:MM · Decision|Added: [[link]]` entry to today's session
     log, creating that note when this is the first real write of the day
     (v3: SessionStart no longer creates one on every open).
  2. Stamp `source_session: <uuid>` into the new file's frontmatter — ONLY
     when the breadcrumb opts in with `stamp_source_session: true` (accepted
     truthy spellings: true|1|yes|on, case-insensitive; absent means off).
     The session log (job 1) already records the session→file mapping, so
     the per-file stamp is opt-in provenance, not a default. Session notes /
     _handoff / _index files are excluded by the stamping primitive.

Both jobs fire only on Write (not Edit/MultiEdit, which typically modify
existing files). Both are best-effort and fail-closed.

This hook spawns no subprocess. Until v3 a job 0 fired
`board_bridge.py --ensure-only` on any Write OR Edit under `tasks/`, which
scaffolded `board-data.json`, `board.html` and a lock file into a vault
project that had never asked for a board — three unrequested files against
six intentional writes. `board` is opt-in: the deck is born by running
`/adjudant board`, and nothing else. Deleting the branch is what let the
PostToolUse matcher narrow back to `Write`, so an Edit anywhere on the
machine no longer wakes this hook for work it cannot do.
