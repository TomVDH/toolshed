# Claude Code statusline v2.6 — shipped by adjudant
# [git] │ [⊙ vault/work-items] │ [model·effort·ctx] │ [agent-bus] │ [24h cost]
#
# v2.6 (2026-09-10): LIVES IN ADJUDANT. This file is adjudant/statusline/
# statusline.sh in the plugin repo, git-tracked and covered by
# test_statusline.py, and reaches ~/.claude through a shim (shim.sh) that
# execs the installed plugin copy. Every adjudant surface it reads (the
# breadcrumb, .beans, board paths, the task ledger) is documented in
# reference/state-contract.md, and a change to one of those now lands in the
# same commit as the matching change here. The git segment also gains one
# glyph: a red ! after the branch when the repo breaks adjudant's branch
# rule (feature beans on feature/<bean-id> in a worktree, main checkout on
# main). See "S1b" below.
#
# v2.5 (2026-09-09): ONE WORK-ITEMS SLOT, and the breadcrumb picks its store.
# beans and the adjudant deck were two separate segments answering the same
# question side by side. Now `tracker:` in .claude/adjudant decides which one
# fills the slot, matching what adjudant's own board does, so the statusline
# and the board can never report from different stores in the same repo.
# The beans count is a clickable link to board.html, same as the deck was.
#
# v2 of claude/statusline-command.sh, which is left untouched so that reverting
# is a one-line edit of ~/.claude/settings.json (statusLine.command). Both
# scripts render side by side. Design decisions and their rationale live in
# ~/.claude/plans/take-a-look-at-nested-music.md; the short version:
#
#   - The bar reports REMAINING, not used. Filled cells are headroom.
#   - Selected values are deviations against a personal baseline rather than
#     bare levels: the commit clock tints against this repo's median gap, the
#     board reports which way it moved rather than only where it stands.
#   - Signals that are always on were cut, because a signal that never varies
#     carries no information (the session-note marker, the always-visible
#     dream age, the commit hash on an ordinary branch).
#   - Glyphs only, never emoji — the convention the v1 palette already stated
#     but broke with ⚡.

# ── Why there is no width-aware truncation ───────────────────────────────────
# There used to be a `term_width=$(tput cols)` here, plus a plain-text twin of
# every colored segment, built so the line could shed segments when it outgrew
# the terminal. None of it was ever wired up, and it can't be: a statusline
# command CANNOT learn the terminal width.
#   - stdout is always a pipe (Claude Code captures it), so `tput cols` returns
#     the terminfo default 80 regardless of the real width.
#   - /dev/tty is not available — the subprocess has no controlling terminal.
#   - The stdin JSON carries no width field (checked against the full documented
#     schema: model, workspace, context_window, rate_limits, effort, vim, agent,
#     pr, worktree, cost, output_style — no columns anywhere).
# Claude Code renders the line with Ink's wrap:"truncate", so an over-long line
# is hard-cut at the right edge, never wrapped. Segment ORDER is therefore the
# only lever we have over what survives a narrow terminal — which is why the
# render at the bottom puts the least actionable segment last. Don't reinstate
# tput; measure nothing; just keep the ordering honest.
#
# v2 attacks the same problem from the other end: rather than shedding segments
# under pressure, it spends fewer columns to begin with. The hash is gone on an
# ordinary branch, the session marker is gone entirely, the board and the dream
# stay silent until they have something to say, and S2's "· " separators were
# dropped because every item already leads with its own glyph. A quiet line is
# ~78 columns against v1's ~110, so truncation fires far less often. It is
# mitigation, not a fix: an alarm state is still ~153 columns.

# Bounded file read. TCAT's targets are vault files in iCloud, so the real hazard
# is eviction: reading a "dataless" (evicted) file blocks until iCloud finishes
# downloading it, which would hang the whole repaint. macOS reports st_blocks == 0
# for such files while st_size stays non-zero, so they can be identified from
# metadata alone — without touching the contents that would trigger the download.
# Evicted files are skipped outright rather than waited on; a statusline should
# render stale-but-instant, never block. GNU timeout, where present, bounds the
# rest. macOS ships neither timeout nor gtimeout by default, so plain cat is the
# fallback (the old inline `timeout 0.2s cat` silently produced nothing on macOS).

# ── Baseline cache ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# against YOUR rhythm rather than an arbitrary constant) and a weekly snapshot of
# the board's open count (so it can report direction, not just position).
#
# An earlier draft put this behind a locked background refresher, mirroring
# statusline-tokens-24h.sh. It was dropped: after the design was trimmed the
# work came to ~7ms total, which is cheaper to do inline than to fork a process
# for. So the repaint computes these itself — but only when the cache is older
# than a day, meaning it pays ~7ms once per day and nothing on every other
# repaint.

# Lives under ~/.claude, never iCloud: nothing to sync, nothing to conflict
# between machines, and it survives a reboot (unlike /tmp).

# ── S0: grind clock + break blurt ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every so often, once you have been at this too long, the entire statusline is
# replaced by an insult telling you to get up. This is the only section that
# renders by REPLACING the line rather than contributing a segment to it, and
# the only one that exits early — see the render note at the bottom of the file.
#
# THE CLOCK IS NOT THE SESSION. /tmp/claude-session-epoch (written by the
# SessionStart hook) is global and stomped by every new window, so a "3h
# session" measured that way resets the moment you open a second tab — exactly
# backwards for a break nag. Instead the clock is derived from the repaint
# itself: the statusline is only rendered when Claude Code renders, so a gap in
# `seen` IS idle time. Walk away for GRIND_IDLE and the clock restarts; keep
# working across four windows and it keeps counting. One human, one machine,
# one shared cache file — deliberately not session-keyed.
#
# The cost is one builtin read per repaint and one redirect at most every
# GRIND_SEEN_TTL seconds — no forks on either path. See the note by
# GRIND_CACHE for why this section does not use the _cache_* helpers.

# ── S0b: account badge — amber C for corporate, silent for personal ──────────
# Which Anthropic account is signed in, reduced to a single letter. Nothing in
# the statusline's stdin carries this, so it comes from ~/.claude.json's
# oauthAccount.emailAddress — of which ONLY the domain is ever compared and only
# the letter is ever rendered. The address itself never reaches the terminal.
#
# SILENCE MEANS CONFIRMED PERSONAL. Corporate shows an amber C, personal shows
# nothing (a deliberate choice — the common case should cost zero columns), and
# anything else shows a dim "?". That last arm is the load-bearing one: an
# unreadable file or an unfamiliar domain must NOT render as "nothing", or a
# failure to determine the account becomes indistinguishable from a personal
# session, and the badge would be lying exactly when it matters.
#
# ~/.claude.json is rewritten on almost every interaction, so a read can and
# does land mid-write and come back empty. Hence the cache is not only a speed
# trick, it is the fallback: an empty read keeps the last known letter instead
# of blanking the badge, which is what stops it flickering on and off. Its mtime
# is useless as a cache key for the same reason (it changes constantly), so this
# is a plain TTL — the signed-in account changes at most a few times a year, and
# switching it requires a /login that takes far longer than ACCT_TTL anyway.
#
# jq over the whole 144K file measures ~6ms — faster than `grep -m1 -o`, which
# has no newline to bail at and must regex-scan the entire single-line document.
# The TTL amortises that to roughly nothing.

# ── Beans counts, read BEFORE the work-items slot ────────────────────────────
# beans (github.com/hmans/beans) stores issues as markdown beside the code, so
# it is file-is-truth in exactly the way the agent-bus is, and it reads the same
# way: walk up for the marker, then one pass over the files.
#
# It does NOT shell out to the `beans` binary. The load-bearing reason is that
# `beans list` EXITS 0 when there is no project, printing its error to stdout —
# so an exit-code check would render a segment made of an error message.
# Reading frontmatter cannot be fooled that way.
#
# Cost is the lesser reason, and measured rather than assumed: the spawn is
# ~10ms against a ~70ms repaint, so it would have been affordable. Reading the
# files is free — baseline and instrumented repaints both best-of-5 at 70ms.
#
# The marker is `.beans.yml`, not the `.beans/` directory: the config names the
# data path and a project may move it. Default is `.beans`.
#
# Statuses, from `beans update --help`: in-progress, todo, draft, completed,
# scrapped. OPEN MEANS DRAFT, TODO OR IN-PROGRESS. Draft used to be excluded
# here on the reading that it is "not yet work", but beans itself files draft
# with todo (internal/ui/styles.go:175), and the disagreement was not academic:
# a not-yet-started child scored as a finished one, so an untouched epic read
# as complete. One definition of open, and it is the tracker's.
# Priorities: critical, high, normal, low, deferred.
#
# Renders this and nothing more:
#   ◍ 7    seven open beans
#   ▸2     two of them in progress
#   ⬡1     gold: one milestone is three quarters done
#   ⬡2     orchid: two epics are three quarters done
#   ✕3     three open beans are bugs
#   !1     one open bean is critical

# ── S1b: branch-rule drift, one red ! in front of the git segment ────────────
# adjudant's branch rule (reference/repo-standards.md, "Git practice"): a
# feature bean works on feature/<bean-id>, always in a linked worktree, and
# the main checkout stays on main. The full report is `/adjudant status`;
# the bar shows one glyph so the drift is seen before the next commit.
#
# Gated on `tracker: beans` in the breadcrumb, so a repo that never adopted
# the rule is never nagged, and on S1 having found a branch at all. Three
# conditions, cheapest first; the first hit wins and nothing else runs:
#   1. This is the main checkout (no ⑂) and the branch is not main/master.
#      Pure string test on values S1 already has.
#   2. The branch is feature/<id> and <id>'s bean is completed or scrapped:
#      the worktree outlived its bean. One awk over one file.
#   3. An in-progress feature bean has no feature/<id> branch. One
#      `for-each-ref` (~5ms), and only when the awk pass listed any such bean.
# Sits in front of the branch like ⑂ does, because s1_col is already
# assembled by the time the beans scan has run and splicing into its middle
# would couple this block to S1's layout.

#   out/<id>.md        the worker's answer; absent while the lane is in flight

# So: no out file = still running; a BLOCKED/QUESTION first line = it is waiting
# on YOU. Those two get loud colors because ignoring them stalls the whole run.
