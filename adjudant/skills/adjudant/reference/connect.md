# /adjudant connect

Onboard project to vault. **One rigid path — no flags, no branching, idempotent.**

## Contract flow (locked)

connect is three phases; the card in the middle is the only thing the user must read.

1. **Infer.** Run `connect.py --contract --project-root {code root} [flags]`. The JSON
   contract carries the five required fields (vault, slug, project_type, initial_status,
   purpose) with inferred values pre-filled, plus the per-agent artifact disclosure
   (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, breadcrumb, vault scaffold, .gitignore) each marked
   already-present or will-create.
2. **Confirm.** Render the contract as ONE card, both halves. Ask the user to approve or
   correct the five fields once. purpose is the one field with no inference: ask for it
   if empty; it becomes the brief's opening line and what sitrep orients from. If
   `contract.zone` is `_fridge` or `_archive`, add one nudge line: project is
   shelved; move its folder back to `projects/` by hand to reactivate it.

   **When `contract.tracker.ask` is set, put that question on the same card.** The repo
   has a beans project, so who owns the work items is a choice and connect will not make
   it. Say what each answer means: `beans` seeds the board from `beans list` and writes a
   drag back to the bean, and `tasks/` stops being used here; `vault` keeps today's
   behaviour and leaves beans alone. Pass the answer as `--tracker beans|vault`. Omit the
   flag and the breadcrumb keeps whatever it already says, which is what makes a re-connect
   safe: a repo already set to `vault` is never switched behind the user's back.
   `contract.tracker.beans_installed` is false when this machine has no binary — still a
   valid choice, the repo just cannot be driven from here until it does.

   **When the answer is `beans`, run `beans prime` and follow it before tracking any
   work.** That command is the tracker's own guide for agents, and adjudant never
   restates it: `beans prime` is generated from the repo's own `.beans.yml`, so the
   types, statuses and priorities it lists are that project's. A copy pasted in here
   would go stale the first time beans changed, and would already be wrong for any
   project configured differently. The short version, which the SessionStart banner
   carries every session in a beans-owned repo: work items live in beans, not in the
   vault and not in a todo list. Find or create a bean before starting, keep its
   checklist current, and commit the bean file with the code.
3. **Apply + receipt.** Run connect.py with the confirmed values (`--purpose`,
   `--initial-status`, plus the usual flags). Render `summary.receipt` back as the same
   card with per-artifact marks: created / already-present / updated. A re-run on a
   healthy project shows all already-present and writes nothing new. For `coding` and `plugin`
   projects the receipt closes with one board pointer: tasks/ holds the cards;
   run /adjudant board to open a deck on them (opt-in, never auto-seeded).

Config knobs land in the breadcrumb at init with defaults visible on the card:
`cost_warn_tokens` (the build profile's default), `stale_after_days: 30`, `tracker`
(`vault` unless the user chose `beans` on the card). Existing overrides survive re-connect,
as does an opt-in `stamp_source_session: true` (per-file session stamping, default off —
connect never writes the key itself).

## The 5 features (locked spec)

1. **Breadcrumb** — write `.claude/adjudant` at project root containing `vault_path`, `vault_name`, `slug`, `mode`, `cost_warn_tokens`, `stale_after_days` (plus `stamp_source_session` when a hand-added opt-in already exists)
2. **Context files** — provision `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + `GEMINI.md` at project root from the matching templates (skip if files exist)
3. **Vault scaffold** — create `{vault}/projects/active/{slug}/` with `brief.md` (from `templates/brief.md`, its `<!-- when: -->` sections resolved for the project type). No subfolders and no indexes: a folder exists once a write puts something in it.
4. **Session note** — create today's `{vault}/projects/{zone}/{slug}/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` from `templates/session.md` with frontmatter filled in
5. **Gitignore** — append `.claude/adjudant` to project `.gitignore` (create file if missing)
6. **Base dashboards** — install `templates/bases/dashboard-*.base` into `{project}/bases/`, each `file.inFolder(...)` filter rewritten to the project's real vault path (sessions, decisions, tasks, freshness views). Write-if-absent: an edited dashboard is never clobbered by an idempotent re-run.

## Inputs

`/adjudant connect` takes no arguments. Resolves everything from environment:

| Need | Resolution order |
|---|---|
| Vault path | `--vault-path` arg → `OB_VAULT` env var → `--vault-name` arg → existing breadcrumb → walk parent dirs for `Home.md` with `type: vault-home` or `type: index` → guided location setup (see below) |
| Project slug | existing breadcrumb → cwd basename (enforce kebab-case) |
| `project_type` | existing brief → prompt once (`coding | knowledge | plugin | tinkerage`) |
| Project display name | prompt once if creating new |

## No vault yet? Guided location setup

Coworkers keep their notes in different places, and many will not have a vault at all. When the vault cannot be resolved (no `OB_VAULT`, no breadcrumb, no `Home.md` up the tree), do NOT guess a path. Walk the user through choosing one:

1. Run `connect.py --suggest-vaults`. It prints the vault-location options that exist on THIS machine as JSON: cloud-sync roots first (`recommended: true`), then local-only folders.
2. Present them as a short numbered list. Recommend a **cloud-sync** root (iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) so the vault follows the user across machines; note that a **local** folder (`~/Documents`) is fine for a single machine. The user may also type any absolute path.
3. Ask for a vault name (default `Claude Vault`). The vault will live at `<chosen root>/<vault name>`.
4. Create and scaffold it in one step:

   ```
   connect.py --project-root {code root} --vault-path "<root>/<vault name>" --create-vault --purpose "..." [flags]
   ```

   `--create-vault` makes the directory (and its `projects/` folder) when it does not exist; connect then scaffolds the project inside it as usual, and writes the breadcrumb so later sessions resolve it silently.

If a vault already resolves, skip all of this: connect uses it without asking.

## Idempotent behavior

Re-running on an already-connected project fills gaps; never overwrites user content.

- Existing `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` untouched
- Existing `brief.md` untouched
- Missing subfolders created; existing untouched
- Today's session note: if exists, no-op (the SessionStart hook handles append-on-resume separately)

## Fail conditions

- Vault path can't be resolved AND user declines to provide one → exit non-zero with message
- `project_type` not provided → inferred from repo signals (never exits non-zero for this)
- Slug contains invalid characters (spaces, dots, uppercase) → exit non-zero with rename suggestion

## Subfolders

There are no default subfolders. `connect` creates the project directory and
`brief.md`, and stops.

Every other folder is created by the write that puts something in it, from the
one table in `scripts/_place.py` that maps each kind to its folder. `project_type`
still decides which `<!-- when: -->` sections the brief gets; it no longer decides
which empty folders a project starts with.

This retires the brief's `extra_folders:` field. It existed to excuse a folder
from a comparison against the per-type defaults, and there are no defaults left
to compare against.
