# /adjudant board

Scaffold a self-hosted **kanban board** — a *standard project
surface* any adjudant project can have, not a one-off. The board is a single,
dependency-free `board.html` (drag a card between lanes; it auto-saves to disk
via the File System Access API on Chromium, with a localStorage mirror) driven
by a sibling `board-data.json`. Each board namespaces its own browser + disk
state by `boardId`, so a portfolio of project boards served from the same
localhost never clobber one another.

The board wears **Adjudant Classic**: a 70s corporate-paper memo in warm cream
OKLCH stock, brown-black ink, one warm orange accent and no rounded corner
anywhere. It is ported from the ZenaSoft design system, whose own references are
IBM annual reports c.1973, Container Corp of America, Mobil corporate guidelines
and Knoll spec sheets. Fonts are named, never fetched: the board is served off a
disk and validator 24 fails the build on any off-machine `href`, so the display
serif resolves through its declared fallbacks.

It is a *view*. A card's face carries its title, the first two lines of its
note, and its id; open the card for everything else. Category colour is
data-driven — names get OKLCH palette hues by index, or supply explicit
`{ "name": "oklch(...)" }`.

## The card, and the card opened

The face is a `<button>` inside the draggable card, so there is still one tab
stop per card: click it, or focus it and press `Enter`. Its sheet opens against
the right edge of the board and carries **every field the card holds**, because
the opened card is where a person goes to see the whole item and a field that
reaches nowhere else is a field they cannot see at all:

| Section | Carries |
|---|---|
| Lane | the lane rail (below) |
| Note | the whole note, `Pretty` or `Raw` (below) |
| Tags | one chip per tag |
| Relations | `Parent`, `Blocked by`, `Blocking` and `References`, each under its own name |
| Details | `Id`, `Category`, `Priority`, `From`, `Created`, `Updated`, `Slug`, `File`, `Etag`, `Task status`, and the lane a card was dragged out of while that move has not reached the deck yet |

A row appears only when the card actually carries that field, so the sheet never
shows an empty one.

The **lane rail** is one button per lane in a scrolling track, the current lane
lifted out of it, one press to move the card. It is the move control for a phone
and for a screen reader, and it replaced a tap-then-tap mode that existed only on
devices matching `(pointer: coarse)` and that nothing on the page announced. It
scrolls rather than wraps: a segmented control folded onto a second row reads as
broken, and a vault board has seven lanes. The note toggle is drawn as the same
control, because it is the same idea.

**The note is Markdown, and is read as Markdown.** A bean's body is Markdown, and
a note shown as one flat run with the syntax still in it is source rather than a
note. The sheet renders the subset bodies use: headings, emphasis, code, fenced
blocks, lists, quotes, rules and links. `Raw` is one click away and keeps every
character, and the choice is remembered for every board this browser opens. The
card face always shows the note's text with the syntax stripped, because two
lines of card preview spent on `## ` is two lines of punctuation.

The reader builds DOM nodes and never assembles an HTML string. `board-data.json`
is documented as hand-editable and a bean body is written by whoever writes
beans, so a renderer that went through `innerHTML` would hand either of them the
page. For the same reason a link is made clickable only for `http`, `https`,
`mailto` and `obsidian`; anything else is shown as text. Nothing is fetched, and
no library is loaded: the board is one offline file and validator 24 keeps it
that way.

Three marks reach the face, and only when they carry something:

- **Category**, as a coloured swatch and its name, on a card whose category is
  not the deck's ordinary one. A category is the ordinary one when it covers
  more cards than every other category put together. So a beans board of 78
  tasks and 9 epics marks the nine epics and leaves the tasks unmarked, an
  evenly split deck marks all of them, and a deck with one category marks
  nothing. The name is in the card's label, the legend and the sheet regardless.
- **Priority**, whenever the deck carries one. A tracker writes `priority` only
  when it is worth showing (`_beans.to_card` drops `normal`), so the key's
  presence is the whole signal. `low`, `deferred` and their kin are drawn quiet;
  the rest are drawn in the alert colour.
- **Tags**, as quiet chips between the note and the id, minus the deck's
  ordinary ones. A tag is ordinary when more cards carry it than not, which is
  the same threshold that keeps the ordinary category off the face: both marks
  answer the same question, so suppressing one at a majority and the other only
  at unanimity would be arbitrary. On a real beans deck `adjudant` sat on 71 of
  92 cards, so the informative cards were the 21 without it, and absence is the
  one thing a chip cannot show. Three chips, then
  a `+N`: a tracker sets no ceiling on how many tags a card may hold and the
  face must not grow with them. The full set is in the sheet, and every shown
  tag is in the card's accessible name, because an `aria-label` replaces a
  button's contents rather than adding to them.

### The mark

The figure is inline SVG, built at load from path data the template carries. Not
a `data:` URI and not a raster, for one reason each. An external SVG document is
a separate document and cannot see this page's custom properties, so the ink
would never reach it. And a raster large enough to stay sharp on a 3x display,
in both inks, costs more bytes than the vectors do while still being fixed at
one size, which a mark destined for reports and exports cannot be.

The head is filled `#26211a`, which is this theme's own dark `--bg`, so on the
dark scheme the head IS the background colour. That one fill is emitted as
`var(--mark-ink,#26211a)` and the dark block sets the property. No second asset,
no scheme listener, and the right ink before the first paint rather than after
it. Only that fill: the figure is a fourteen-colour illustration, not a
silhouette, so `filter:invert()` would take the plume to cyan and the skin to
blue, and recolouring the cool near-blacks as well takes the pupil with them.

Two fills follow the scheme, not one. On light the eye is a cool near-black
sitting on the head's warm near-black, which reads as modelling rather than as a
mark. Swap only the head and that whisper becomes a shout: a hard dark blob on a
pale cheek. Swap the eye to the same cream and it disappears instead. So both
swap, mirrored, `--mark-ink` warm and `--mark-eye` cool, and the relationship
survives rather than the value.

Path data is rounded to one decimal on a 100-unit grid. Measured against the
original at both 52px and 156px: mean channel error 1.0 to 1.3 of 255.

### Task lists

`- [ ]` and `- [x]` render as state, not as syntax. A tracker's loop is keeping
those markers current, so a board that printed the brackets and drew no
difference between done and open was showing the one thing you did not need and
hiding the one you did. `[x]` and `[X]` are both done; only a space is open.

The box is drawn, never an `<input>`. This board does not write bean bodies, so a
control that cannot be operated would misrepresent what the page can do. It is
`aria-hidden` decoration with a visually hidden "done, " or "to do, " beside it,
because otherwise the distinction would exist only in pixels. Done steps back to
`--text-faint` rather than striking through: a finished item is still read, and
struck text is slower to read when you need to. An ordinary list is untouched,
and inline markdown still parses inside a task's text.

The card face strips the marker along with the bullet, after it rather than
before, since the marker only starts the line once the bullet is gone.

### The display face

Mozilla Headline Condensed SemiBold is embedded as a Latin-1 woff2 subset, 12 KB.
The board is offline-locked, so a face is either carried in the file or absent,
and absent meant every lane heading, stamp and sheet title fell through to Iowan
Old Style: a wide, soft book serif where the brand is a tight condensed slab. A
data URI fetches nothing, which is what validator 24 guards; it bans a `url()`
pointing off-machine, not `url()`. One cut, at 600, so a rule asking for a
lighter weight renders at 600 and only matters if the embedded face fails.

The sheet is a native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, so the focus trap,
`Esc`, the inert background and the top layer all come from the platform. The
top layer is the reason it is a dialog at all: the lane body is
`overflow-y: auto`, and a panel positioned inside it would be clipped.

A card is addressed by its **position** in `cards`, never by its id, for the
same reason a drag is: a deck may legitimately carry two cards with one id. When
a disk refresh or another tab replaces the deck under an open sheet, the card at
that position may no longer be the card that was opened, so the sheet closes and
says so rather than relabelling itself as something else.

## Targeting (which project's board)

| Flag | Board(s) scaffolded |
|---|---|
| *(default)* `--project-dir PATH` | the current breadcrumb-linked project |
| `--project <slug>` | the named project under `{vault}/projects/<slug>` |
| `--all` | one board for **every** project in the vault |

`--project`/`--all` resolve the vault from the cwd breadcrumb (or explicit
`--vault PATH`) and discover projects by **filesystem truth** — every
`{vault}/projects/<slug>/brief.md`, skipping `_`/`.` dirs. The fragile
`projects/_index.md` table is never parsed, so malformed or duplicate rows can't
break discovery. `--all` is error-isolated: one bad project never aborts the batch.

**Containment.** A `--project` slug must be lowercase kebab-case and must
resolve to a path inside the vault, so a traversal slug (or a zone dir that is
a symlink out) is refused rather than scaffolded. A board is written under the
project it belongs to; the one exception is a `--dest` you pass yourself, which
may point at a code repo (see below).

## The features (locked spec)

1. **Scaffold** — `board.py scaffold` writes `board-data.json` (the deck) + a
   self-contained `board.html` (template with the deck injected between its
   `BOARD_DATA` markers; every `<` in the payload is escaped, so task titles
   containing `</script>` or `<!--` can't break the page). Default dest is
   `{vault}/projects/{slug}/board/`; pass `--dest` to target a code repo
   (e.g. `<repo>/_docs/board`). `--dest`/`--data` are single-project only
   (not valid with `--all`).
2. **Seed from tasks** — `--from-tasks` builds one card per `{project}/tasks/*.md`
   note: `code`/`id`/filename → card id, first `# heading`/`title:` → title,
   `status:` → column, `category:`/first non-`task` tag → category,
   `related:` → mono refs, `note:` → note. `_index.md` and roadmap/index files
   (`type: tasks`) are skipped — they aren't per-card task notes. Empty `tasks/`
   yields a clean 6-stage starter deck (no error). Duplicate card ids across
   task notes are disambiguated to the filename stem, with a stderr warning.
   A task note that is not valid UTF-8 is skipped with a named stderr warning
   instead of being decoded lossily: a `U+FFFD` in a card id is permanent,
   because re-saving the note yields a new id and the old card is iceboxed
   forever rather than deleted.
3. **Serve** — `board.py serve --dir DIR` runs a localhost static server so the
   disk-save (File System Access API) works (it needs a secure context, not
   `file://`). `--open` launches the browser; `--port 0` picks a free port
   (the real port is printed); a busy port errors cleanly instead of tracebacking.
4. **Status** — `board.py status [--project SLUG|--all]` prints per-column card
   counts in the terminal (plus a warning for cards in unknown columns) without
   opening a browser. Same targeting flags as scaffold.

## Run

```bash
# the current project, from its tasks/
python3 "$(dirname "$0")/../../../scripts/board.py" scaffold --project-dir "$PROJECT_ROOT" --from-tasks

# a named project by slug (vault resolved from the cwd breadcrumb)
python3 .../scripts/board.py scaffold --project steel-tempest --from-tasks

# every project in the vault, one board each
python3 .../scripts/board.py scaffold --all --from-tasks

# or target a code repo and reuse an existing deck verbatim
python3 .../scripts/board.py scaffold --project-dir "$PROJECT_ROOT" \
  --dest "$REPO/_docs/board" --data "$REPO/_docs/board/board-data.json" --title "My Board"

# serve it (background), then open http://localhost:8787/board.html
python3 .../scripts/board.py serve --dir "$DEST" --port 8787
```

Then present the board, URL first (the line the user acts on): start `serve` in
the background, open the URL, and close with one next step: drag cards, or hit
**connect file** to enable disk auto-save.

## Data model (`board-data.json`)

```json
{
  "version": 1, "boardId": "my-project",
  "title": "My Board", "subtitle": "Work-order board", "updated": "2026-06-24",
  "columns": [{ "id": "backlog", "name": "Backlog" }, ...],
  "categories": ["build", "docs", "infra"],
  "cards": [{ "id": "X-01", "title": "...", "column": "backlog",
              "category": "build", "related": ["SPEC-001"], "notes": "",
              "source": "task", "taskStatus": "todo" }]
  // a beans-seeded card adds, when the bean carries them: priority, tags,
  // parent, blockedBy, blocking, slug, beanPath, createdAt, updatedAt, beansEtag
}
```

- `taskStatus` is the task note's `status:` as of the last reconcile — the
  common ancestor the three-way merge needs. A deck without it is pre-1.0.1
  and reconciles as "unknown", never as "the board moved".

- `boardId` (defaults to the project slug) namespaces the board's browser
  `localStorage` + IndexedDB file-handle, keeping multiple boards independent.
- `done` and `icebox` lanes are marked `BUILT` / `PARKED` in the **lane
  heading**, once for the lane rather than once on every card sitting in it. A
  renamed or added lane sets its own: `"stamp": "SHIPPED"` (or `false` for
  none), `"stampTone": "built"|"parked"`, `"muted": true|false`. A muted lane
  keeps the same well colour as every other lane and quiets its heading.
- A column may carry `"wip": N` — the lane head then shows `count / N` and
  turns red when over the limit.
- Cards whose `column` matches no lane (hand-edited deck, removed column) are
  never invisible — they render in a synthetic **UNFILED** lane you can drag
  them out of. That lane is named **Unfiled**, takes no drops, and shows no
  drop affordance.
- A category colour must be a colour the browser accepts. Anything that could
  fetch (`url(...)`) falls back to the palette hue: the board is served from
  disk and makes no outbound request.
- In-browser view tools (never persisted): a **filter** box narrows by
  id/title/category/ref/note/tag (`Esc` clears all three filters), a **Type**
  rail toggles a category filter, a **Tag** rail under it toggles a tag filter,
  each labelled with the axis it narrows because two rows of identically shaped
  buttons read as one block, and a focused card moves one lane left/right with
  `[` / `]`. A card with no lane of its own is moved from its sheet's lane row.
  The tag rail renders nothing on a deck with no tags, orders tags by how many
  cards carry each one, shows the twelve commonest plus a count of what it left
  out, and always keeps the tag being filtered by within reach. A deck swap that
  retires that tag clears the filter rather than leaving the board looking
  empty.
- The browser persists **only the moves you made by hand**, as
  `{cardId: {from, to}}`. Everything else re-renders from the deck on every
  load, so a re-scaffold that re-seeds a title, category or ref is visible
  immediately, while the lane you dragged a card into survives it. An override
  retires as soon as the deck itself moves that card somewhere else.
- Before writing to a connected `board-data.json` the page **re-reads it and
  merges**, so a reseed's new cards, its icebox moves and lanes you added by
  hand are not overwritten by a tab that has been open since before them. A
  second tab's moves are adopted rather than clobbered. A move that no store
  confirmed is rolled back with a visible message, never left looking saved.

## Idempotency — refresh without clobber

Re-running `board` does not wipe in-progress card state:

- **`--from-tasks` over an existing board → merge.** Per card id: a card present
  in both keeps the **column you dragged it to** (and any board-local `notes`),
  while `title`/`category`/`related` re-seed from the task note. New tasks are
  added in their status-derived column; a card whose task disappeared is moved to
  `icebox` (never deleted). A hand-added card with no `id`, and any second card
  sharing an `id`, is carried through the merge verbatim (it can never match a
  task note); a repeated id also warns on stderr. Deck-level
  `title`/`subtitle`/**`columns`** from disk are preserved — custom lanes you
  added survive a re-seed.
- **Without `--from-tasks` → the on-disk deck is kept untouched** (only `board.html`
  is refreshed from the template, so styling/engine updates land).
- **`--force` → full rebuild from tasks**, discarding dragged columns. It
  requires `--from-tasks` (or `--data`) when a deck already exists — `--force`
  alone would overwrite the board with an empty starter deck, so it refuses.
  Any replace (`--force` or `--data`) first copies the old deck to
  `board/.bak/board-data-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.json`, newest 5 kept. The copy is
  taken once the replacement deck has been read and validated, so a run that
  fails and writes nothing leaves every earlier backup byte-identical. This
  directory is one of the two backup paths that deliberately live inside the
  vault rather than in `$TMPDIR` — see `reference/state-contract.md` for why,
  and for the other.
- **`--data FILE` → that deck verbatim** (missing standard fields are backfilled).
- A corrupt/unreadable `board-data.json` (or `--data` file) exits non-zero with
  a clear error — it never tracebacks or silently rebuilds.

`board.html` is always re-emitted from the canonical template — never hand-fork
instantiations; change `templates/board.html` and re-run.

## Ambient board: birth and passive refresh

The board also maintains itself. `board.py --ensure --project-dir X` is the
ambient form hooks call: birth or reseed, never clobbering drag state, verdict
on the last stdout line:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `no-tasks` | no real task notes (only `_index.md` / `type: tasks` roadmaps); nothing written |
| `created` | first real task note found, no deck yet: board born via the scaffold path |
| `reseeded` | deck existed and the clobber-safe `--from-tasks` merge changed it |
| `no-change` | merge would change nothing; deck untouched, mtime included (no sync churn) |
| `html-refreshed` | only board.html was stale (template drift or vanished page); deck untouched |
| `tasks-synced` | the deck was settled but a dragged lane was missing from `tasks/`: the notes were updated to match (see below) |

### The board writes back (v1.0.0)

The board is a view of the vault, but a drag happens in the view. So every
lane change on **any** surface is pushed back into the task note's `status:`:
a browser drag, an Obsidian kanban drag folded in by the read-back, or a deck
you edited by hand. Without this the note stayed stale forever, because the
merge deliberately keeps the dragged column, and `check`, `dream`, `clean`
and the sitrep board line all read the note rather than the deck.

- Each lane has exactly one canonical status (`CANONICAL_STATUS_FOR_COLUMN`),
  which is why `next` is part of the task vocabulary: a lane no status can
  express is a lane that diverges silently.
- A note is rewritten **only** when its own status maps to a different lane
  than the deck has. So an input alias (`wip` sitting in doing) and a
  distinction the lane cannot express (`blocked` sitting in review) both
  survive untouched, per the never-rewrite-aliases rule.
- **Divergence alone does not license a write (v1.0.1).** Deck ≠ note is
  equally the signature of a drag and of a human editing the note in
  Obsidian, and v1.0.0 read every such case as a drag: marking a task done in
  Obsidian was silently reverted by the next ambient hook, and the log line
  said "from the board" about a card nobody had touched. `taskStatus` is the
  common ancestor that separates the two. Unchanged since the last reconcile
  → only the board can have moved, the drag wins and the note is rewritten.
  Changed → the human moved it, the note wins and `merge_deck` moves the card
  instead. Absent (a pre-1.0.1 deck) → neither store is trusted: this path is
  ambient and has no preview or backup, so it records the ancestor and lets
  the next run decide rather than guessing once, destructively.
- Only `status:` changes; other fields, their order, the body and the line
  endings are left exactly as they were. The write is atomic and locked.
- Cards with no task note (hand-added on the board) are never materialized
  into notes here, and since v3 nowhere else either: write the note yourself,
  or use `/adjudant status --capture-task`.
- It converges: once the note matches, the next run reports `no-change`.

### Kanban surface (v0.23.0)

`scaffold --kanban` also writes `board/kanban.md` in the de-facto
obsidian-kanban format (`kanban-plugin: board` frontmatter, `##` lanes,
`- [ ]` cards), so the same deck renders as a native drag-drop board inside
Obsidian. Born only by the flag; refreshed by every scaffold/ensure once it
exists. The plugin's own state — the `%% kanban:settings %%` block, the
`## Archive` section, any other `%% %%` comment block — survives every
rewrite byte-for-byte. Drags made in Obsidian read back on the next reseed
when `kanban.md` is newer than the deck (unknown lanes keep the deck column;
archived cards never count); the deck stays the single truth. After each
kanban write the scaffold prints an `obsidian://open` URI for the file.

Projects that never grow tasks never grow board files. Passive surfaces that
keep the board current without being asked:

- **SessionStart** renders one board status line: per-column counts plus a
  stale flag when any task note is newer than the deck.
- **SessionEnd** runs `board_bridge.py --ensure-only` when a deck already
  exists, so the last edits of the session reach the board. A session end
  never births a board.

Until v3 a third surface wrote here: PostToolUse fired `board_bridge.py
--ensure-only` on any Write or Edit under `tasks/`, which meant the first task
note scaffolded `board-data.json`, `board.html` and a lock file into a project
that had never run `board`. That branch is deleted. A deck is born by
`/adjudant board` and by nothing else; a task-note edit reaches the board at
session end.

Because two surfaces write the deck, the whole read-merge-write runs under an
advisory lock and both files land via a temp file plus `os.replace`, so a
concurrent reader never sees a half-written deck and two writers cannot lose
each other's work. On a mount where locking does not work the write is still
atomic.

Read-only views: `check` renders a board section, `sitrep` one board line.

`scripts/board_bridge.py` ensures the deck and its HTML match `tasks/`, and
does nothing else. Until v3 it also replayed the session task ledger at close:
every id without a `TaskCompleted` event became a task note. Status changes
other than completion fire no events, so abandoned and renamed todos qualified
too, and `tasks/` filled with cards nobody wrote. A task note is now written
only when someone asks for one — `/adjudant status --capture-task`, or your own
hand. The ledger still lives in `$TMPDIR` for the statusline; nothing reads it
into the vault.

## Beans-owned repos

A repo whose `.claude/adjudant` carries `tracker: beans` is seeded from the
Beans CLI instead of from `tasks/`. `_beans.py` is the only module that runs the
binary, and `board.py` absorbs the answer into the ordinary deck shape before
the page sees it, so `board.html` carries no reference to beans at all.

- Lanes come from `_beans.COLUMNS`: `draft`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `completed`
  (marked BUILT, muted) and `scrapped` (marked DROPPED, muted). The deck carries
  `"tracker": "beans"`.
- Every property a bean can carry reaches the card:

  | Card | Bean | | Card | Bean |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `column` | `status` | | `tags` | `tags` |
  | `category` | `type` | | `parent` | `parent` |
  | `notes` | `body` | | `blockedBy` | `blocked_by` |
  | `priority` | `priority`, when not `normal` | | `blocking` | `blocking` |
  | `slug` | `slug` | | `createdAt` | `created_at` |
  | `beanPath` | `path` | | `updatedAt` | `updated_at` |
  | `beansEtag` | `etag` | | `source` | `"beans"` |

  An optional key is written only when the bean carries it, the rule `priority`
  already followed, so the opened card never grows an empty row.
- `notes` comes from the body, which means `list_beans` asks for `--full`.
  Without it every bean arrived with no description and the board rendered a
  deck of empty notes while every bean had one. It is not a second pass and not
  slower in any way that matters: over 89 beans, `list --json` measured 0.03s
  and `list --full --json` measured 0.02s.
- A beans card's `notes` **re-seeds** on merge rather than being preserved.
  Beans owns the body; keeping the on-disk copy would pin an edited body to
  whatever the board last saw. A task-seeded card still keeps its board-local
  note, which no other writer supplies.
- `parent` is its own field, not folded into `related`. The opened card labels a
  parent, and a labelled relation plus an unlabelled copy of the same id in a
  reference list is one fact said twice.
- Write-back is `beans update --if-match`, real compare-and-swap, so this path
  needs no `taskStatus` ancestor to tell a drag from a hand edit.
- Working in a beans-owned repo is beans' own contract, not adjudant's: run
  `beans prime` and follow it. SessionStart prints a one-line banner saying so
  in any repo whose breadcrumb carries `tracker: beans`, read straight from the
  breadcrumb so no hook ever runs the binary (validator 27).
- A beans-owned repo whose CLI is unreachable **refuses and reports**. It never
  falls back to `tasks/`, which is empty by design there: a fallback would
  reseed the board from an empty folder and replace a deck of real beans with an
  empty board.

## Merge provenance (refresh-without-clobber)

Task-seeded cards carry `source: task`. On re-seed, a `source: task` card whose
backing `tasks/*.md` note disappeared is parked in `icebox` (never deleted);
cards **without** task provenance (hand-added in the board UI, or from a
pre-provenance deck) keep their current column untouched.

## Fail conditions

- No breadcrumb at cwd → the target dir is treated as the vault project dir itself
  and the board scaffolds there (deliberate scaffold-anywhere escape hatch; run
  `/adjudant connect` first if you wanted the breadcrumb flow).
- `--project`/`--all` with no resolvable vault → exit non-zero ("pass `--vault PATH`
  or run from a connected project").
- `--project <slug>` not found → exit non-zero, listing the available slugs.
- `--dest`/`--data` combined with `--all` → exit non-zero.
- Template missing / `BOARD_DATA` markers absent → exit non-zero (don't emit a
  half-written board).

## What board does NOT do

- No live sync to GitHub issues / Jira / a database — the JSON is the source of truth.
- No multi-user/server backend — single-file, local, disk-or-browser persistence.
- No card creation in the browser. A card comes from a task note or from a bean:
  write the note yourself, or use `/adjudant status --capture-task`. (This
  section used to claim there was no status write-back to `tasks/` either, which
  the "The board writes back" section above has contradicted since v1.0.0.)
