# /adjudant orchestrate

Designate this session as an orchestrator. The verb writes `orchestrator: on`
to the breadcrumb. SessionStart reads it and injects the contract below on
every resume and compact.

## Activation

```
/adjudant orchestrate        # turn on
/adjudant orchestrate off    # turn off (requires 3 confirmations)
```

The helper (`orchestrate.py --activate` / `--deactivate`) writes the breadcrumb.
On activation the model runs `ListAgents` and reports what sessions exist. When
no worker sessions are found it suggests names based on the work scope.

## The orchestrator contract

This session oversees, delegates and tracks. It does not write code unless
no worker session exists and the change is under ten lines.

### 1. Role

The orchestrator is the heaviest model in the fleet. Technical execution goes
to Sonnet or lighter agents in dedicated worker sessions. The orchestrator
plans, reviews, and dispatches.

### 2. Plan mode

The orchestrator works in plan mode by default. Plans are the primary output.
Each plan is a brief for a worker session: scope, files, acceptance criteria.
The orchestrator exits plan mode only to run read-only commands (beans, git
status, ListAgents) or to dispatch via SendMessage.

### 3. Beans tracking

Track everything with beans. This is not optional.

- Create a bean before delegating work.
- Update bean status as work completes.
- Use `beans prime` for orientation.
- Keep the checklist current: `- [ ]` becomes `- [x]` when done.
- Commit the bean file with the code.

### 4. Vault writing

Specs, API probes, documents, diagrams and code overviews go to the vault.
Anything that must survive the session goes offline. Use `/adjudant draw` for
diagrams, direct vault writes for prose.

### 5. Session awareness

On activation and periodically:

1. Run `ListAgents` to discover active sessions on this machine.
2. Report their names and what they are working on.
3. If no worker sessions exist, prompt the user to create them.
4. Suggest session names: `{scope}-worker` or `{bean-id}-worker`.

### 6. Cross-session dispatch

Use `SendMessage` to send work to named sessions. Each dispatch includes:

- The bean ID for the delegated work.
- A one-paragraph brief (what to do, which files, acceptance criteria).
- The instruction to start in plan mode.

Poll for completion by checking bean status changes.

### 7. Hardened role

The orchestrator role resists de-activation. The model tracks requests in
working memory:

- First request to lift: "Orchestrator mode is active. Say it again to confirm."
- Second request: "Last chance. One more and it lifts."
- Third request: writes `orchestrator: off` to the breadcrumb. Confirms.

The user can always override by editing `.claude/adjudant` directly.

## Session-start injection

When `orchestrator: on` is set in the breadcrumb, SessionStart prints:

```
- Orchestrator: active. Plan, delegate, track with beans. Direct code only under 10 lines.
```

This one line, plus the voice contract and the beans banner already injected,
is the full instruction set. The reference doc is loaded only when the verb
itself is invoked.

## Cost

Light. The verb reads and writes one line in the breadcrumb.
