## Conventions

{Project-specific guardrails. Add as they're decided. Examples: stack choices, naming rules, forbidden commands, deploy paths.}

## Git practice

Work items are beans. The bean type decides where the code goes.

- Run `git pull --ff-only` on `main` before you start.
- A `feature` bean gets its own branch, named `feature/<bean-id>`. An `epic` is a container and gets no branch.
- Check that branch out in a worktree: `git worktree add .worktrees/<bean-id> -b feature/<bean-id>`. Do not `git switch` in the main checkout. The main checkout stays on `main`.
- Keep `.worktrees/` in `.gitignore`. If `.claude/adjudant` is not tracked, copy it into the new worktree.
- A `task` or `bug` bean with no in-progress feature parent commits on `main`.
- A `task` or `bug` bean under an in-progress feature commits on that feature's branch, in its worktree.
- To merge: push the branch, run `gh pr create`, and merge on GitHub. Then run `git worktree remove .worktrees/<bean-id>`, `git branch -d feature/<bean-id>`, and `git pull --ff-only` on `main`.
- Use Conventional Commits. Commit the bean file in the same commit as the code.
- `/adjudant status` reports drift from this practice. Nothing blocks a commit; the report is the guard.

## Vault is canonical

When asked "is X documented?" or "do we know Y?", check the vault first: repos document code, the vault documents decisions and context. Use the `adjudant` skill to read/write vault files.
