"""Beans as a work-item source. The ONE module that runs the `beans` binary.

Beans (github.com/hmans/beans) is a CLI issue tracker storing issues as
markdown in `.beans/`. Where a repo uses it, Beans owns the work items and
adjudant stops writing vault task notes there. Adjudant keeps everything Beans
does not do: sessions, decisions, briefs, handoffs, indexes, draw, dream.

TWO FACTS, NEVER CONFLATED
--------------------------
  owns(code_root)  — does this REPO use Beans?  breadcrumb `tracker: beans`.
                     Persistent, travels with the repo, read in microseconds.
  available()      — is `beans` on THIS MACHINE? shutil.which, never persisted.

They are orthogonal because the repo is mirrored across machines and the binary
is a Homebrew install that may exist on only one. Conflating them turns a repo
that is Beans-owned on one machine into a broken repo on the other.

    repo says | machine has | behaviour
    ----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------
    vault     | no beans    | today's behaviour, byte for byte
    vault     | beans       | today's behaviour
    beans     | beans       | this module drives it
    beans     | no beans    | REFUSE AND REPORT. Never fall back to vault.

The last row is why `owns()` does not call the binary. A Beans-owned repo has
an empty `tasks/` by design, so falling back would reseed the board from an
empty folder and replace a deck of real beans with an empty board. The work
would look like it had vanished.

WHY THE CLI AND NOT THE FILES
-----------------------------
Reading `.beans/*.md` directly would reimplement Beans' id generation, its
index and its etag semantics, and would break the first time Beans changes its
own format. The CLI is the supported contract, it already emits JSON, and it is
the only thing that hands us compare-and-swap (`--if-match`).

NO HOOK MAY IMPORT THIS MODULE'S RUNNING HALF. Hooks fire on every Write and
every Bash call; `beans list --json` measured 52-62 ms. The `beans-not-in-hooks`
validator enforces it.
