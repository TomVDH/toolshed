"""Adjudant board bridge: vault task notes to board.

The board is a view of `tasks/`. This script ensures the deck and its HTML
exist and match the notes on disk, and nothing else.

Until v3 it also replayed the session task ledger (hooks/scripts/task-ledger.py)
at session end: every id whose latest event was not `TaskCompleted` became
`tasks/{kebab-subject}.md`. Status changes other than completion fire no
events, so abandoned, superseded and merely renamed todos all qualified as
"survivors" and all became permanent vault notes. An id without a
`TaskCompleted` event is an unfinished harness todo, not a work item, and
treating it as one filled `tasks/` with cards nobody wrote. The replay is
gone; the ledger itself stays in $TMPDIR, where the statusline reads it.

CLI:
    python3 board_bridge.py --ensure-only [--project-dir PATH]

`render_task_note` stays: the advisor's `capture-task` verb writes a task note
on an explicit request, which is the supported way one gets created. It goes
through `_render` now. The inline fallback copy of the template is gone, and
with it the comment stripper that existed because the fallback and the real
template disagreed: the fallback declared `code`, `note` and a `task` tag,
none of which is a v3 field, and the real template's guidance comments
survived the minimal YAML parser and poisoned card ids.
