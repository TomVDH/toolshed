"""Adjudant board — scaffold a self-hosted work-order kanban board for a project.

Generates `board-data.json` (the deck) + a self-contained `board.html`
(drag-to-move, auto-saves to disk via the File System Access API). The deck can
be seeded from the vault project's `tasks/*.md` notes, from an existing
`board-data.json`, or left as an empty 6-stage starter.

The board is a *view*: cards carry short ids and mono `ref` tags that cross-link
your own codes (specs, handoffs, commits). Category colour is data-driven —
names get palette hues by index, or supply explicit `{name: oklch(...)}`.

The board verb is a **standard project surface**: any project adjudant knows
about can have its own board, addressed by slug. Targeting:

    --project-dir PATH   the current breadcrumb-linked project (default)
    --project SLUG       a named project under {vault}/projects/{slug}
    --all                every project in the vault (one board each)

CLI:
    python3 board.py scaffold [--project-dir PATH | --project SLUG | --all]
                              [--vault PATH] [--dest DIR] [--from-tasks]
                              [--data board-data.json] [--title STR] [--force]
                              [--kanban]
    python3 board.py serve --dir DIR [--port 8787] [--open]
    python3 board.py status [--project-dir PATH | --project SLUG | --all]
    python3 board.py --ensure [--project-dir PATH]

`--ensure` is the ambient form (hooks, session-end bridge): birth the board
when the first real task note exists, reseed when tasks changed, push a lane
dragged on any board surface back into the task note's `status:`, refresh a
stale board.html when a plugin upgrade shipped a new template, write nothing
otherwise. Verdict (created/reseeded/tasks-synced/html-refreshed/no-tasks/
no-change) is the last stdout line.

`scaffold` is idempotent and *refresh-without-clobber*: re-running with
`--from-tasks` against an existing board merges the current task state into the
deck while preserving the columns you dragged cards into (use `--force` for a
full rebuild). `board.html` is always refreshed from the template.
